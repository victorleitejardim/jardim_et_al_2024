This document contains all data analyses presented in the main text as well as supporting information mentioned and extra information on the analysis for those interested (not cross-referenced).

The analysis was organized using the make-line pipeline tool provided by targets [@landau2021]. You will find raw data as well as all functions used in the pipeline in the project's research compendium created with the rcompendium package [@casajusn.2022].

You can take a look at the pipeline in order to have an idea of the different steps for creating the main models and figures. Each target is defined at the \_targets.R file in the research compendium.

Taxa from 14 phyla were identified, and Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca and Echinodermata were dominant, although Chordata, Cnidaria and Nemertea were also abundant at some sites. Some beds were consistently dominated by polychaetes, while others were always dominated by crustaceans, and a few were more even over the years with dominance shifts between Annelida, Arthropoda and Mollusca (@fig-phylord). Maerl annelid communities were dominated by the mobile predators eunicids (Eunicidae, Lumbrineridae, Dorvilleidae), the crawling surface deposit feeders spionids (Spionidae), the tube dwelling suspension feeding sabellids (Serpullidae), and the subsurface deposit feeding knot worms (Polygordidae; @fig-fam - A). As for arthropods (@fig-fam - B), the decapods were dominant in most beds, namely the filter-feeding porcelain crabs Pisidia longicornis (Linnaeus, 1767; Porcellanidae), which was consistently dominant. The subsurface deposit feeding Corophiidae amphipods and Apseudiidae tanaids, as well as the scavenging Lysianassoidea amphipods were also abundant in most sites. Finally, maerl mollusc communities (@fig-fam - C) were mostly dominated by small grazing and deposit feeding gastropods (Cerithiidae, Rissoidea and Trochidae), by endo and epifaunal filter-feeding pectinid bivalves (namely Veneridae), and by chitons (Leptochitonidae).

# Effects of HC on regional diversity patterns

## Redundancy analysis

After variable selection, we add sites as a factor to understand if we describe them well with the environmental variables we chose. We can look at the first two axes to have an idea of the relationships between the different explanatory variables.

Adjusted R^2^: `r RsquareAdj(rdasite)$adj.r.squared`. We check the model's validity. Only 99 permutations were chosen for the validation by axis and by term here as they are really time consuming but the results are the same with 999 permutations. (Output is collapsed, click on code to see)

### Total macrofauna

Now we first forward select environmental variables and then add sites as a random factor to control for pseudo-replication and other site-related variables that were not taken into account.

We check models with quadratic functions of both PC1 and PC2 to test for a unimodal relationship. Unimodal trends are never significant, suggesting an overall linear relationship. A significant interaction is found between PC1^2^ and both PC2 and PC2^2^ in the last model in @tbl-S1. Since there's a very slight difference in AICs and BICs between the last two models, we keep the more parsimonious one.

:::

As we can see, the marginal R2 for the models containing only a subset of the macrofauna are quite low. However, although the effects of HC are less evident in these cases, the pattern for most subsets is very similar to the general pattern, with very slight positive effect of rhodolith complexity and a more important positive effect of bed complexity. Nevertheless, rhodolith complexity seems to play a more important role in driving annelid richness than the other main phyla.
